			<p>Hi, welcome to this page. Here I'm talking about the different types of 
		braids.</p>
			<p>Women braid their hair for several reasons. It keeps hair out of the way and
		it looks lovely, in our opinion. Braids have been around since 3500
		BC, and they were used in people's hair to indicate marital status, ethnicity,
		religion, tribe, and other things, at least in African tribes. However, other cultures formed their
		own braiding styles and now they are pretty much a fashion staple because of how practical and attractive
		they are.
		
		Without further ado, here
		are several styles of braids out there. Some of these are easy to do, 
		some of them need more practice and effort to get done right. </p>

					<h2>1. The regular 3-strand braid</h2>
				
					<p>Now here's a classic and easy-to-do braid. This is the first type of 
					braid that women tend to learn, I think, and I remember this being the
					first one I learned myself.</p>

					<h2>2. The fishtail braid</h2>
				
					<p>This braid is easier to do at the side rather than at the back, though
					you can certainly do it at the back of your head. Basically with this one,
					it's like doing a regular braid, but you cross sections of one strand of hair
					over to the other repeatedly. </p>

					<h2>3. The French braid</h2>
				
					<p>This braid is kind of like the regular 3-strand braid mentioned above, but you 
					start at the top of the back of your head, add hair from each side as you braid
					from there, and then braid the rest of your hair the regular way when you get to 
					the nape of your neck. This type of braid is great for keeping your hair out of
					the way when you travel or work out, but it can be for when you're not doing either
					as well. I personally could never get this one right even with a french braiding
					tool, until I found an easier way to do it on YouTube.</p>

					<h2>4. The Dutch braid</h2>
				
					<p>So this braid is pretty much the reverse of the French braid, and is called
					as such sometimes. Instead of having strands go over the middle, they go under,
					and then the braid seems like it's popping out in the end. You can wear this
					one at the back of your head or at the sides.</p>

					<a name="cornrow_braids"></a>
					<h2>5. Cornrow braids</h2>
				
					<p>These braids are considered fun and practical. They also protect your hair from heat damage.
					Cornrow braids are worn more often by African-American women and girls, as they have naturally
					curly hair and it is hard to style it, so these braids help in that sense.</p>

					<a name="rope_braid"></a>
				
					<h2>6. The rope braid</h2>
				
					<p>This type of braid is also called a false braid. It's kind of easy to do, as all
					you've got to do is part your hair into two strands, twist each in opposite directions,
					and then wrap them around each other. Rope braids are popular for their simplicity.
					I personally learned how to do them when I was in college and I thought they looked
					lovely. (In the picture, the rope braid is the part of the girl's hair that is from
					the beginning of the ponytail to the end.)</p>

					<h2>7. The mermaid braid</h2>
				
					<p>I think this type of braid has its name because from top to bottom, it's the shape of
					a mermaid's tail. There are different ways to style this one, but I've found that it's
					easier than it looks. The easiest version I've seen is just making two regular 3-strand
					braids, one at each side of your head, then securing them together at their backs with a 
					bobby pin. Depicted below is just one look of the mermaid braid. </p>

					<a name="milkmaid_braid"></a>
					<h2>8. The milkmaid braid</h2>
				
					<p>In the past, this kind of braid was the way early milkmaids did their hair, more because
					it was practical for working, whether or not it was hot. Sources say the milkmaid braid
					came from either Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, or Greece. Now it's a popular way
					to wear your hair. You can do this one with regular braids and/or fishtail braids. The 
					milkmaid braid is not as hard as it looks and there are different versions of it. </p>

				All right now, I can't possibly talk about all the different types of braids out there,
				but you've come across several above on this page. If you're interested, here are some
